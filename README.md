# Si4703 Radio

> Overview

I started this project to practice my C coding skills, and to learn more about how STM32 peripherals work. It uses an STM32F103 microcontroller and an Si4703 FM module to make a basic desktop radio. I am not setting out to write an fully featured library for the Si4703, I am only implementing functions that I need for this specific project.
